    "## Part A: Deterministic Shortest Path\n",
    "The Shortest Path Problem (SPP) involves finding the shortest path between two specific nodes in a weighted graph. In a graph, nodes represent points or locations, and edges represent connections between those points. A weighted graph includes numerical values associated with each edge, indicating the \"cost\" or \"weight\" of traveling between the connected nodes. The goal of the shortest path problem is to determine the path from a starting node to a target node that has the minimum total cost among all possible paths. The cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the edges along that path. Consider the following example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Tom, who resides in City \"A\", is planning a journey towards City \"H\". Given his limited funds, he has devised a strategic plan to spend each night during his expedition at the abode of a friend. Tom has friends in cities \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", \"E\", \"F\", and \"G\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Tom is mindful of optimizing his energy expenditure, and he is aware of the limited distances he can cover each day. On the first day of travel, he can comfortably reach City \"B\", \"C\", or \"D\". On the second day, he can reach City \"E\", \"F\", or \"G\". Ultimately, Tom can reach his destination, City \"H\", on the third day.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conserve energy and navigate his journey efficiently, Tom must strategically decide where to spend each night along the route. It's imperative for him to consider the energy requirements between cities, which are outlined in the subsequent table. By skillfully selecting his overnight stops, Tom can ensure his expedition is both cost-effective and successful.\n",
