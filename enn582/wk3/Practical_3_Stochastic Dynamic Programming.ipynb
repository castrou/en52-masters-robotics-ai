Ultimately, Tom can reach his destination, City \"H\", on the third day.\n",

The energy consumed during travel is dependent on random factors, including weather, traffic, etc. We can model this randomness with a probability distribution.

To conserve energy and navigate his journey efficiently, Tom must strategically decide where to spend each night along the route. It's imperative for him to consider the energy requirements between cities, which are outlined in the subsequent table. By skillfully selecting his overnight stops, Tom can ensure his expedition is, in average, both cost-effective and successful.\n",

With the high chance of very small cost, B seems to be the better choice, although considering A -> B and A -> C, the decision is less clear. A -> B is likely to have a higher cost, but leads into a high chance of minimal cost; while A -> C may result in a higher cost, it is more consistently lower, and has a higher likelihood of minimal cost, but leads into mid-range cost with C -> F.
